[00:06.13] When August comes
[00:09.23] I don't count the days
[00:12.53] Transitory views
[00:15.68] From the subway train
[00:18.75] How strange
[00:22.09] When life unfolds this way
[00:25.74] In the driftless zone
[00:28.89] Sky's are prone to stay off-gray
[00:35.78] Clouds are omens too
[00:39.18] Fading at the rate
[00:41.88] Most pleasant memories do
[00:46.11] ...
[00:55.70] This is a lost taste
[00:57.13] ...
