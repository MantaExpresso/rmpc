[00:19.56] Hear it in your tone
[00:24.60] You're slowly letting go
[00:29.57] Are you turning off your phone? Oh
[00:35.13] Feelings turn cold
[00:38.46] So cold, for you
[00:48.87] So cold, for you
[01:01.82] Oh, I try to break apart, oh
[01:12.70] You don't wanna try no more, more, no more
[01:23.03] Why, why, oh
[01:26.42] Do you live in my mind, mind? Oh
[01:32.57] Said you looked past my love (oh)
[01:37.72] While I came with open arms
[01:42.43] For you
[01:52.74] For you
[02:00.73]
